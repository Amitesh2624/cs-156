This repository contains all work done for Caltech CS 156 Learning Systems course.
Note: Problem set 1 is missing (used as a drop set). 


Also, the Honor Code that "No member of the Caltech community should take unfair advantage of another member of the community" applies.
You'd be breaking the honor code accessing these solutions as a student taking this class :(


Also, to reproduce my LaTeX set up, simply copy all files in the latex folder for each set and paste in Overleaf/locally. 
If you have a main.tex workflow already, simply use my main.tex file's Preamble (before begin{document}) to have the same styles.
The lindrew.sty file is NOT mine. Credits are in the comments of this file.
